To download a game, just join a room and if you don't have the rom already it will auto download for you.

If something goes wrong, make sure to delete the rom inside the respective emulator folder, delete the problematic rom itself and some tmp files that might be there.

**If the script breaks for some reason come back here and check if there's a newer one.**
