### Changelog:

**FRM JSON Pack - 9/7/2021 (v5)** 

Biggest Update ever, after a few days of non-stop working, all games were reuploaded to a better server
(thanks tobemorecrazy!) and some json files even made from scratch

- All games were reuploaded
- Quicker downloads
- All flycast naomi and atomiswave games should work
- Preemptive support for upcoming external save states (Getting ready for Flycast GGPO)
- NES roms will be fixed in a future update (thats on frm side)

I also made a ko-fi page if for some reason you want to support me, although I encourage you to
support the fightcade devs, flyinghead (flycast dev) and blueminder (flycast-dojo dev) first!

To download a game, just join a room and if you don't have the rom already it will auto download for you.

If something goes wrong, make sure to delete the rom inside the respective emulator folder, delete the problematic rom itself and some tmp files that might be there.
